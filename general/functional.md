# Functional Programming

- **Pure Functions**: A function that returns the same output given the same input and has no side effects.
- **Immutability**: The practice of not changing the state of objects once they are created.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take one or more functions as arguments, or return a function as its result.
- **Recursion**: A technique of defining a function in terms of itself.
- **Function Composition**: A technique of combining multiple functions into a single function.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Delaying the evaluation of an expression until it is actually needed.
- **Referential Transparency**: A property of pure functions, where a function call can be replaced with its return value without affecting the program's behavior.
- **Pattern Matching**: A technique of matching data structures against predefined patterns.
- **Currying**: Transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.
