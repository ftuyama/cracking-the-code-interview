# Programming

Programming paradigms are different approaches to writing computer programs that reflect different styles of thinking about program structure and execution. 

Each paradigm has its own set of rules, principles, and concepts that define how programs should be written and how they should behave.

## Programming paradigms

1. **Imperative**: C, C++, and Java.
2. **Functional**: Haskell, Scala, and Clojure.
3. **Object-oriented**: Java, Python, and Ruby.
4. **Event-driven**: JavaScript and C#.
5. **Declarative**: SQL and Prolog.
