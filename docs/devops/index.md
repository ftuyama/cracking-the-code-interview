# Devops

DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to improve the speed, quality, and reliability of software delivery.

The goal of DevOps is to reduce the time and effort required to develop, test, deploy, and maintain software, while ensuring that the software is delivered on time and meets the needs of its users.

## Word meaning

DevOps is a combination of two words, "Development" and "Operations," and involves breaking down the silos between these two teams to create a more collaborative and integrated workflow. 

DevOps practices and tools are designed to automate and streamline the entire software development lifecycle, from planning and development to testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## What does it include?

DevOps practices include:

- Continuous integration (CI)
- Continuous delivery (CD)
- Continuous deployment (CD)

Which are designed to automate the testing, building, and deployment of software. 

DevOps also emphasizes the use of monitoring and logging tools to track the performance and availability of software in production environments, and the use of feedback loops to continuously improve the quality of software.

## Tols

Some popular tools used in DevOps include:

- Git for version control
- Jenkins for continuous integration
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for container orchestration

## Conclusion

DevOps also involves a cultural shift towards collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility between development and operations teams.

In summary, DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, automation, and feedback loops to improve the speed, quality, and reliability of software delivery.
