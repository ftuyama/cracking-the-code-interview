# Phonetic

## /θ/, /t/ and /ð/

- **/t/ sound**: In Portuguese, the "t" sound is pronounced with the tongue touching the alveolar ridge (the bumpy area behind the upper teeth). This is the same place where the English "t" sound is articulated.

- **/θ/ sound**: This sound is produced by placing your tongue between your upper and lower front teeth, and blowing air out. You should feel your tongue between your teeth as you make the sound.

- **/ð/ sound**: This sound is similar to the /θ/ sound, but instead of blowing air out, you vibrate your vocal cords. You should feel your vocal cords vibrating as you make the sound, but your tongue should still be between your teeth.


```
/θ/ is voiceless, it is made only with air 
/ð/ is voiced; it is made with vibration of the vocal cords
```
