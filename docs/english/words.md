### Z

Try blocking air with the tip of your tongue behind your teeth. 

Then push the air out for a buzzing sound (like a bee).

### puh

Make sure your lips are closed, then release the air all at once with a puff.

### l

Make sure the tip of your tongue is behind your teeth. Keep your tongue a little tense as you let the air out the sides.
