## Class #1

```
MIGRATION:
push factors > push people away from X place
pull factors > things that are appealing
```

```
He's a developer just like me
He's a developer just like I am
```

This sentence uses the full phrase "I am" to compare the speaker with the mentioned individual. It places more emphasis on the speaker's identity as a developer and explicitly states the similarity between the two individuals. It is a more formal or grammatically complete way of expressing the comparison.

## Class #3

`Can`: ability - permission - possibility

```
I can help you if you want (possibility)
Can you drive? > yeah, I got my license (ability)
Teacher, can I go to the bathroom? (permission)
T: I don't know, can you?

FORMAL ENGLISH: DO NOT USE CAN
hey man, can you pass me a beer?
hey man, may you pass me a beer?
```

`Could`: ability that you lost -  "possibility" that didn't occur

```
past of can
when I was younger, I could pull all-nighters really easy

> ONE occasion > be able to / manage to
after walking for 5 hours, I could reach the top of the mountain.
had the chance.... but I didn't
I could help her... (I had the chance... but I didn't)
```

`Might`: possibility

```
may / Might > EXCLUSIVELY for possibility
"poder" > "puede que"
```

### Can vs Could

You can use them both to make requests but could will always be more formal, and it's preferred specially when
asking people to do something.

- Hey, mate, can you help me" (To a friend, or someone close)
- Could you help me, please? (To an stranger, a superior, or someone not so familiar)


### Can vs Be able to

Be able is a synonym of can. But the former is considerably more formal, and a little less common in speaking.

- I can handle myself in a kitchen.
- I am able to handle myself in a kitchen.
- I could swim really fast when I was kid.
- I was able to swim really fast when I was a kid.

However, Can is a modal verb, and modals do not like to mix with others.
So, when mixing with others such as: have, will, should and so on, can just sounds wrong.


### Can vs May/Might



### May vs Might

There is a difference, but it is not as noticeable nowadays.
- The weather may/midht be better tomorrow.
- Craig may/might know his results soon.
- We may/might go to the cinema tonight.

So, feel free to use one or the other... except in the following cases:

- May I. - To ask/give permission
