Fricative consonants are made by squeezing air between a small gap as it leaves the body.

## Plosive consonants

Plosive consonants are made by completely blocking the flow of air as it leaves the body, normally followed by releasing the air. 

English pronunciation contains 6 plosive phonemes: `/p,b,t,d,k,g/`:

### Pronounce

The sounds `/b,d,g/` are voiced; they are pronounced with vibration in the vocal cords. 

The sounds `/p,t,k/` are voiceless; they are produced with air only. 

The voiceless plosives are often aspirated (produced with a puff of air) in English pronunciation.

### Examples

```
/p/: purse
/b/: bell
/t/: talk, stopped
/d/: done, played
/k/: kite, cone, queen, chronic, excited
/g/: gone, exhaust
```

### Glottal Stop 

The voiceless alveolar plosive sound /t/ is often replaced with a voiceless glottal plosive in connected speech. 

This most frequently occurs when /t/ appears at the end of a syllable and the following sound is a consonant:
