# Channels

Channels and ActionCable are both part of the web framework Ruby on Rails and are used for real-time communication between clients and servers.

## Channels 

Provide a way to handle bidirectional communication in a Rails application. 

A channel is an object that allows the server to push data to the client without the client needing to send a request. With channels, you can implement features like chat rooms, real-time notifications, and online gaming.

## ActionCable 

It is a framework that is built on top of channels and provides a way to create real-time web applications using WebSockets. 

WebSockets are a protocol that allows for a persistent, two-way communication channel between the client and the server. ActionCable provides an easy-to-use API for creating WebSocket connections, defining channels, and broadcasting data to clients.

With ActionCable, Rails applications can implement real-time features without the need for additional libraries or tools. It provides a seamless integration with the rest of the Rails stack, making it easy to develop and maintain real-time web applications.
