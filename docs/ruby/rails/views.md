# Views

## Partials

A partial is a reusable view component that can be shared between views. 

Partials are typically used to avoid duplicating code between views, and to organize the code in a more modular way. Partials are defined as separate files that can be rendered from within other views.

## Helpers

Helpers are Ruby methods that can be used in views to perform common tasks, such as formatting dates, generating links, or displaying images. Rails comes with a set of built-in helpers, and you can also define your own helpers to suit your application's needs.

## Layouts

A layout is a template that defines the overall structure of your application's pages. Layouts typically include common elements such as headers, footers, and navigation menus, and can be used to provide a consistent look and feel across your application.
